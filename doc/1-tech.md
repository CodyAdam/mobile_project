# About Android Technology

As an Android developer, you can choose to create native apps using either **Jetpack XML** or **Jetpack Compose**.

## Jetpack XML
Jetpack XML is a **traditional way of developing** native Android applications using XML for the user interface and Java or Kotlin for the code logic. It is **based on the Android framework View hierarchy** and is simple and easy to learn.

## Jetpack Compose
Jetpack Compose, on the other hand, is a **modern** and **reactive UI toolkit** for building native Android applications. It is based on the declarative programming paradigm, which makes it **easier to write and maintain** the code. Instead of XML, you write the UI in code using Kotlin and the Compose components.

## Our choice

Our team is doing two projects side by side to compare **both** Jetpack XML and Jetpack Compose and will use **Kotlin** for both projects.
